<center><h1>INDIA</h1></center>
<p>India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[22] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[23][24] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[25][26][27] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.
Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[32] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[33][34] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[37] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[39] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[40] but also marked by the declining status of women,[41] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia, especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[384] Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few with human figures. The "Pashupati" seal, excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best known.[385][386] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[386][387] Almost all surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement.[388][389][390] In the first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[391] Over the following centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana ("breath" or life-force).[392][393] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the Ardhanarishvara form of Shiva and Parvati.[394][395]
Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati,[396] or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later.[397][398] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.[399] Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu sculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[400][401] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[402] But in the South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[403][404]
Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves a.The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[410][411] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[412][413] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[414][415]</p>

<pre><h3>History</h3>
<p>In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into <br>16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[93][94] <br>The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions.<br>Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[95] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha,<br> attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[96][97][98]<br> In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[99] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions.<br> Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[100] <br>The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, <br>but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[101][102]<br>The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and <br>far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhammaBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the<br>Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.<br>[28][29][30] <br>The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[28]<br>After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures,<br>and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84]<br> These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84]<br> the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during 2500–1900<br> BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] <br>Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence,<br> the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[86]</p>

<h3>Economy</h3>
<p>According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022 was nominally worth $3.46 trillion;<br>it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, around $11.6 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[306]<br> With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[307]<br> India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[308] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[309]<br> Until 1991, all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics.<br> Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world.<br> An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[310] since then,<br> it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[311][312] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[313] India has been a member of World Trade. 
Organization since 1 January 1995.<br>During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[88]<br>The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this period,[90]<br>and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[88]<br>Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[89]<br>The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants,<br>but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[91] 
On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[88] 
In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[92] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture,<br> irrigation tanks, and craft traditions</p>

Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly accomplishment in Gupta times.[405][406] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in larger paintings.[407] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits, and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[408][409] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[410][411] As a market developed among European residents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable Western influence.[412][413] <br>In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2022 was nominally worth $3.46 trillion; it was the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates and is, <br>around $11.6 trillion, the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).[306] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[307] India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies.[308]<br> However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.[309] Until 1991, <br>all Indian governments followed protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;[310] since then, it has moved increasingly towards a free-market system[311][312] by emphasising both<br> foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[313] India has been a member of World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.</p>
