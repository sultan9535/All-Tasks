        <p>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS, GUIDANCE, RULES FOR
            RESPONDING / ANSWERING TO
            MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
            Note
            To be explained and elaborated by the teacher / headmaster prior and or before initiating,
            starting the practice worksheet assessment.
            1. There are four options, ie., itâ€™s a Multiple Choice Question (MCQ), only one option out of four is
            correct and appropriate, which the student need to tick.
            2. Students must note and remember, out of four options, there is only ONE appropriate / correct
            answer, the remaining three are distractors (wrong-response options).
            3. Students thus must not tick more than one tick mark, if marked more than one tick, say
            in two or three options, the response would be considered wrong.
            4. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) are designed and developed to assess competencies based
            learning outcomes along with basic and foundational pieces of knowledge related to their
            course. Thus, please read each question carefully before reading the answer options. When you
            have a clear idea of the question, find your answer and mark your selection on the correct /
            apprioriate option accordingly.
            5. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) are designed to assess your ability to think critically about the
            subject. Please read each question carefully before reading the answer options. Be aware that
            some questions may seem to have more than one right answer, but you are to look for the one
            that makes the most sense and is the most correct.
            6. These four sets of practice worksheet assessment needs to be conducted in following two days
            / dates only ie., 8
            th and 9th September 2023.
            7. All students of Class 3, 5, 8 and 10 enrolled in school MUST attempt and participate in this
            assessment, so that they get familiarised with such MCQ assessments. </p>
